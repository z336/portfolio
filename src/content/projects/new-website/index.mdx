## Overview

For my personal site I really wanted to create something that's fast and accessible, but still shows my personality.

## Technologies & Skills

- <a href="https://www.gatsbyjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">
    Gatsby
  </a>
  , a React based framework
- CSS: Grid, Flexbox, <a href="https://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sass</a>, <a href="https://styled-components.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Styled Components</a>
- JavaScript
- Responsive web design
- Code in <a href="https://github.com/z336/portfolio" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GitHub</a>, hosted by <a href="https://www.netlify.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Netlify</a>

## Features

Areas of focus for this site:

### Accessibility

- An intentionally high contrast design that safely scores AAA on <a href="https://whocanuse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">whocanuse</a>.
- Visible focus styles and an efficient tabbing flow throughout pages for keyboard users.
- Semantic HTML and Aria labels for screen readers.
- Dark mode for sensory sensitives (and I mean, it's fun).

### Performance

I knew from the beginning that I was not going to be piping in loads of API data or doing much heavy lifting on this site internally, but I think building on the JAMstack was still a great decision. Fast load times and efficient image processing are big wins for UX.
